Description: AlphaBeta is a computational method for estimating epimutation rates and spectra from high-throughput DNA methylation data in plants.
    The method has been specifically designed to:
    1. analyze 'germline' epimutations in the context of multi-generational mutation accumulation lines (MA-lines).
    2. analyze 'somatic' epimutations in the context of plant development and aging.
